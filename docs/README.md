# open-astrophysics-learning
A beginner-friendly, Python-based introduction to stellar astrophysics and HR diagrams.
Open Astrophysics Learning

Learn Astrophysics Through Real Data, Code, and Scientific Thinking

Open Astrophysics Learning is a free, open-source learning initiative designed to help students understand stellar astrophysics using real data and Python, rather than memorization or textbook-only learning.

This project focuses on how astronomers actually work — combining physics, data, and computation.

🎯 Who is this course for?

High school students interested in astronomy or astrophysics

Students curious about Python in science

Learners who want to understand stars, H–R diagrams, and spectroscopy

Anyone who wants a research-style introduction to astrophysics

No advanced background is required — curiosity and consistency are enough.

🚀 What makes this course different?

You analyze data, not just read theory

You learn astronomy through real scientific workflows

Python is used as a tool, not as an end goal

The course builds scientific thinking, not rote learning

This is how astrophysics is actually done.
