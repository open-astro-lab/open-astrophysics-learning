# AstroAccess — Module 1  
## Classifying Stars Using Data and Python

---

## Who is this for?

This module is designed for **high school students** who are curious about astronomy and want to learn how astronomers actually study stars using **data**.

You do **not** need advanced mathematics.  
You only need **curiosity** and a willingness to try.

---

## What is this module about?

In textbooks, we often memorize star types such as:

- Main sequence  
- Giants  
- Supergiants  
- White dwarfs  

But real astronomers do **not** memorize star types. Instead, they:

- Collect data  
- Plot graphs  
- Look for patterns  
- Draw conclusions  

In this module, **you will do the same thing using Python**.

## What you will learn in this module

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand what a **Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) Diagram** represents  
- Use **real numerical data** of stars  
- Plot an **HR Diagram using Python**
