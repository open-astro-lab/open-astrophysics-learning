Module 3
Introduction to Spectroscopy
________________________________________
What is spectroscopy?
Spectroscopy is the study of light coming from objects in space. When we observe stars, planets, or galaxies, we are actually receiving light that carries a huge amount of information. By analyzing this light, astronomers can understand what an object is made of, how hot it is, and how it is moving.
Spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools in astrophysics because it allows us to study objects that are extremely far away and cannot be touched directly.

Why light is important in astronomy
Almost all information we get about the universe comes through light. Stars emit light because of nuclear reactions happening inside them. This light changes depending on the star’s temperature, composition, and motion.
Instead of just looking at how bright a star is, spectroscopy breaks the light into different colors or wavelengths and studies them carefully.

What is a spectrum?
A spectrum is the result of spreading light into its component colors or wavelengths. A simple example is a rainbow formed when sunlight passes through water droplets.
In astronomy, spectra are usually displayed as graphs that show intensity versus wavelength. These graphs help astronomers identify patterns that reveal physical properties of stars.

Types of spectra
There are three main types of spectra used in astronomy.
A continuous spectrum is produced by hot, dense objects like stars. It shows a smooth range of colors without gaps.
An absorption spectrum occurs when light from a hot source passes through a cooler gas. Dark lines appear in the spectrum where certain wavelengths are absorbed by elements.
An emission spectrum is produced by hot, low-density gas. It shows bright lines at specific wavelengths corresponding to elements emitting light.

Spectral lines and elements
Each chemical element absorbs and emits light at specific wavelengths. These appear as lines in a spectrum and act like fingerprints for elements.
By studying these spectral lines, astronomers can determine which elements are present in a star or nebula, even if it is millions of light-years away.

Temperature and spectroscopy
The shape of a spectrum and the strength of its lines depend on temperature. Hotter stars show different spectral features compared to cooler stars.
This is why spectroscopy is closely linked to star classification. Temperature measurements from spectra help place stars correctly on the HR Diagram.

Doppler effect in spectroscopy
Spectroscopy also helps measure motion. If a star is moving toward us, its spectral lines shift toward shorter wavelengths. If it is moving away, the lines shift toward longer wavelengths.
This effect is called the Doppler effect and is used to study binary stars, galaxies, and even detect exoplanets.

Why spectroscopy is essential in astrophysics
Spectroscopy allows astronomers to determine chemical composition, temperature, velocity, and evolutionary stage of stars.
Without spectroscopy, astronomy would be limited to surface-level observations. Spectroscopy turns light into data that can be analyzed scientifically.

How spectroscopy connects to this course
In this course, spectroscopy will be used in a simplified way to understand how data is extracted and analyzed using Python. You will learn how spectral information connects to star classification and HR Diagrams.
The goal is not to memorize wavelengths but to understand how physical information is hidden inside light.
________________________________________
Light is not just brightness. It is information.
Spectroscopy is the method that helps astronomers read that information.

What comes next
In the next module, you will work with sample spectral data and learn how to plot and analyze it using Python. This will connect theory with real astronomical research methods.
