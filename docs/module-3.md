# Module 3: Introduction to Spectroscopy

## What is Spectroscopy?
**Spectroscopy** is the study of light emitted or reflected from objects in space. When we observe stars, planets, or galaxies, we receive light that carries a vast amount of information. By analyzing this light, astronomers can determine:
* **Composition:** What an object is made of.
* **Temperature:** How hot the object is.
* **Motion:** How fast it is moving and in what direction.

Spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools in astrophysics because it allows us to study objects that are billions of light-years away and cannot be physically sampled.

## Why Light is Important in Astronomy
Almost all information we gather about the universe comes through light. Stars emit light due to **nuclear reactions** occurring in their cores. This light changes based on the star’s physical state. Instead of just measuring a star's brightness, spectroscopy breaks that light into its component colors or wavelengths to study them in detail.

## What is a Spectrum?
A **spectrum** is the result of spreading light into its component colors. A common example is a rainbow formed when sunlight passes through water droplets. 

In professional astronomy, spectra are usually displayed as **graphs** showing **Intensity vs. Wavelength**. These graphs allow astronomers to identify specific patterns that reveal the physical properties of celestial bodies.

## Types of Spectra
There are three main types of spectra categorized by **Kirchhoff's Laws**:

| Type | Description | Origin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Continuous** | A smooth range of colors without gaps. | Hot, dense objects (like a star's core). |
| **Absorption** | Dark lines appearing against a continuous background. | Light passing through a cooler, thinning gas. |
| **Emission** | Bright lines at specific wavelengths against a dark background. | Hot, low-density gas (like a nebula). |

## Spectral Lines and Elements
Each chemical element absorbs and emits light at specific, unique wavelengths. These act like **fingerprints**. By studying these lines, astronomers can identify the presence of elements like Hydrogen, Helium, or Iron in a star or nebula millions of light-years away.

## Temperature and Spectroscopy
The shape of a spectrum and the strength of its lines are heavily dependent on **temperature**. 
* **Hotter stars** emit more light at shorter (bluer) wavelengths.
* **Cooler stars** emit more light at longer (redder) wavelengths.

This connection is fundamental to **Star Classification** and placing stars accurately on the **Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram**.

## The Doppler Effect
Spectroscopy is also used to measure motion through wavelength shifts:
* **Blueshift:** If a star moves *toward* us, spectral lines shift to shorter wavelengths.
* **Redshift:** If a star moves *away* from us, spectral lines shift to longer wavelengths.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This effect is crucial for detecting exoplanets and measuring the expansion of the universe.

## Summary: Why Spectroscopy is Essential
Without spectroscopy, astronomy would be limited to simple photography. Spectroscopy transforms light into scientific data, allowing us to determine:
1. Chemical Composition
2. Temperature
3. Radial Velocity (Motion)
4. Evolutionary Stage

## How This Connects to the Course
In this course, we will use **Python** to:
* Extract data from digital spectra.
* Plot Intensity vs. Wavelength graphs using libraries like `Matplotlib`.
* Classify stars based on their spectral signatures.

**Light is not just brightness; it is information.** Spectroscopy is the method we use to read that information.

### What Comes Next
Next, you will work with sample spectral data files and learn how to visualize and analyze them using Python code.
